        <h3>Easy80</h3>

        <p>2018-08-16</p>

        <p>Easy80 is an instruction accurate Z80 CPU emulator, at least it will be when it's finished. This is a learning project for me more than anything. After working my way through two other emulators for toy computer systems (<a href="https://github.com/crmaykish/chip-8-emulator">CHIP-8</a> and <a href="https://github.com/crmaykish/hack-emulator">Hack</a>), moving on to a real, but simple, CPU seemed like the next step. The jump in complexity was significant.</p>
        <p>I've been interested in the Z80 CPU for some time now, going as far as buying up some old stock online and putting together a primitive single-board computer based on the historic CPU. I plan to revisit that project at some point. The experience of writing an emulator will certainly be enlightening even when it comes to building and programming a real system.</p>
        <p>Code for this emulator is available on <a href="https://github.com/crmaykish/easy80">GitHub</a>. I am about 85% of the way through implementing opcodes. I will need to develop or find some testing tools to validate the accuracy of my emulation before I go much further. Once I have a working CPU core, I think I'll use it to create a full system simulator. I've got my eye on the ZX Spectrum and the Sega Master System.</p>
